## File naming convention for raw and derived data
We will follow the CellExplorer data structure and format:  https://cellexplorer.org/datastructure/data-structure-and-format/


### General Principles for naming variables, functions and scripts
- **Consistency**: Stick to the chosen convention throughout the codebase.
- **Avoid Abbreviations**: Unless widely recognized or obvious, avoid abbreviating variable names.
- **Meaningful Names**: Prioritize meaningful and descriptive names over short, cryptic ones.

| Names                          | Naming Convention               | Examples            |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Variable Names**             | Lower Camel Case                | `variableNames`     |
| **Function Names**             | Lower Camel Case                | `functionNames`     |
| **Script Names**               | Lowercase with Underscores      | `script_names`      |
| **Class Names**                | Upper Camel Case                | `ClassNames`        |
| **Struct Fields**              | Lower Camel Case                | `structFields`      |
| **Temporary Variables**        | Short and Contextual            | `temp`              |
| **Loop Indices**               | Single Letters if span is short scope, otherwise please use meaning full names  | `i` and `iShank`   |
| **Logical (Boolean) Variables**| Prefix with is, has, can, should, etc. | `isValid`    |
